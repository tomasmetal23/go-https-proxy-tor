# Go TLS to Tor Bridge

A simple Go application that acts as a TLS-enabled bridge to the Tor SOCKS5 proxy. This project aims to provide a secure and easy way to tunnel traffic through the Tor network, accessible via HTTPS.

## Key Features (Planned):

* **TLS Encryption:** Listens for incoming connections over TLS (HTTPS) on a specified port (default: 443).
* **Traffic Discrimination:** Intelligently identifies regular HTTPS web traffic and proxy traffic (like SOCKS5 or HTTP CONNECT).
* **Web Server (Optional):** Can serve a simple web page for direct HTTPS access (e.g., for status or configuration).
* **SOCKS5 Proxy Bridge:** Forwards recognized proxy traffic to a local Tor SOCKS5 proxy (default: `host.containers.internal:9050`).
* **Easy to Use:** Designed with simplicity (KISS principle) in mind, aiming for easy configuration and deployment.

## Use Cases:

* Providing a Tor-backed proxy accessible over HTTPS.
* Tunneling application traffic through Tor via a secure TLS connection.
* Potentially bypassing network restrictions that might block direct Tor access.

## Current Status:

This project is in its early stages of development. The current focus is on establishing a basic TLS listener and a simple web server in Go. Future development will include the logic for traffic discrimination and the bridging to the Tor SOCKS5 proxy.
